                    Back in college my good buddy Mike and I decided to do something really, REALLY stupid;
                    to eat a Doubledown Sandwich from KFC. Now dont get me wrong, it was delicious. But it
                    far and away was the single most-dense thing I'd ever eaten. Three days later when I was
                    finally able to exorcise the demon the result inspired me to create this composition.
                    I'll let you draw your own conclusions here.<br /><br />
