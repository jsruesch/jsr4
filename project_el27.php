                put something together as fast as I can that I like enough to use as my desktop background.

                I'm a home-grown thoroughbred Wisconsinite. And that means I'm a die hard cheesehead. When Eddie Lacy
                burst onto the frozen tundra a few years ago I was blown away by his game. I loved how hard he ran. How
                it would take AT LEAST two or three guys to slow him down. I can't tell you how many times either I or
                someone I was watching the game with said "He runs like a beast!". That thought plus seeing his dreads
                made me immediately think of the Predator. I now know that his thing is The Hulk, but I made this first.
                Who knows, maybe an Eddie Lacy Hulk piece is on the way ;)
