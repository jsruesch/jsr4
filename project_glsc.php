                Each year the <a href="http://www.gameslearningsociety.org" target="_blank">Games + Learning + Society </a>
                hosts the <a href="http://www.glsconference.org" target="_blank">GLS Conference</a> here in Madison,
                where folks from the education and educational games field from all over the world travel to give talks,
                network, and share about everything educational games related. I had the pleasure of working with their
                conference organizers and volunteers to give them a fresh brand and to design all the web and print goodies
                they needed to make this event go off without a hitch.
