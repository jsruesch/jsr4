                        I'm Jake. I feel there are few things that work as an outlet for creative expression as
                        well as art. Over the last 8+ years I've developed a deep love for a wide variety of
                        visual designs. I could be grabbing a set of images and turning them into a cohesive,
                        dynamic composition. Or, maybe I’m creating a responsive, user-friendly, intuitive
                        website or creating high-detail vector art. You name it; I’m into it. In the world
                        of design, there is so much to explore it’s a waste not to try out different styles
                        and mediums. <span class="bold tteal">Life has turned in to one giant create your

                        One of my favorite aspects of creative work is collaboration. I feel like being able to give and receive
                        feedback and using it to iterate on a piece leads to better work. The ability to give concise and
                        insightful feedback is something I consider incredibly important. 
                        <br /><br />
                        I always say <b>I'm not afraid of hard work</b>. I love to be challenged. Something
                        I've always prided myself on is my ability to meet deadlines and to produce high-quality
                        work at break-neck speed. Over the years, I've been blessed to have the chance to
                        work with some phenomenal people on great projects for UW Madison, New York Hall
                        of Science, The Center for Investigating Healthy Minds, DeVry, The Wisconsin Institutes
                        for Discovery, Learning Games Network, Design Concepts, Games + Learning + Society,
                        Spark Media, the Higher Education Video Game Alliance and many more. I've built 
                        websites ranging from one-page microsites all the way to conference websites viewed
                        by thousands of people. I've created a variety of print materials. I've dabbled
                        in video editing and effects. I've worked with teams of programmers, modelers,
                        and animators to create fun and intuitive games for education. These experiences
                        have made me realize how excited I am that I've only hit the tip of the iceberg.
                        There's still so much to learn and create. So why am I still blathering on?
