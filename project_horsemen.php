                I made this piece during college for an art history class. It's a spin on the tale of the four
                horsemen of the apocalypse. I decided rather than showcasing the horsemen as
                the beings riding the horses that I'd make them the horses themselves. Each horse has elements of the
                horsemen they represent depicted in some way. Can you figure out which is which?
