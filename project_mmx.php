                    put something together as fast as I can that I like enough to use as my desktop background.

                    I LOVE the new MMX figurine
                    that was recently released
                    ( <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/truforce/truforce-collectibles-mega-man-x-action-figure" target="_blank">get it here. it's amazing! </a>). There were tons of great images of the figure
                    posed in really badass poses. One of those plus some MMX backgroung buildings and a little sprinkle of
                    added zazz and here is the result.
                    <br /><br />
