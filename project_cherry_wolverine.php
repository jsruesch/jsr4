                    <span class="bold">I love fighting games.</span> A group of friends and I used to get together weekly to square
                    off for hours on end to see who was the strongest. When I got word that one of my
                    good buddies from the group was moving out of state I felt it was only fitting to
                    try and cram as many of our ridiculous inside jokes into a goodbye tribute piece
                    as I could. The hardest part of puting this piece together was sourcing high enough
                    quality images to make sure the final product could be printed really big. Nothing
                    makes me happier than to think of Gary having to look at a giant goofy image like
                    this on his wall every day.
