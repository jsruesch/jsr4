                One blustery January night, deep in the heart of Wisconsin's northwoods a small caravan of fortunate
                souls encountered the elusive and incredibly dangerous Deer Lion. Not just one, but an entire pride of
                Deer Lions. The Deer Lions passed in front of the caravan with blinding speed and ferocity. One lone
                Deer Lion trailed behind the rest of the pack, this was clearly the Alpha in this pride. As it walked slowly
                in front of the vehicle it stopped, looked at the passengers, and nodded as if to convey respect and acceptance.
                It was in this fateful moment that the team formerly known as Tenney Park Tre Kronor became TPTK: The Pride.
                They would forever adorn their garb with the mantle of the Deer Lion to instill fear into the hearts of
                their opponents.
