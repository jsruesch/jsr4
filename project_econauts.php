                Econauts uses real-time-strategy gameplay to teach users about the impact of various types of
                real-world roles. Loggers, builders, and miners compete against each other to try and make the most
                profit while at the same time preserving the most environment. This was a real treat to work on. The
                concept artists and modelers really did a great job with the in-game and character art.
