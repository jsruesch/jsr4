                put something together as fast as I can that I like enough to use as my desktop background.

                Dark Souls is one of my favorite video games series of all time. These games consume me every time I
                decide to venture back in to their unforgiving worlds I find myself lost for hours on end. I still remember
                the first time I fought The Persuer. His entrance was so awesome. For this speedcomp I tried to
                capture that feeling and energy I felt when I first walked through that fog gate.
