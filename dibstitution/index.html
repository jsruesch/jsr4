      <h1>The Dibstitution as drafted by the Congress of Dibs, 2017</h1>
      <p>
        There comes a time in the course of human history when beings of sound mind, body, and spirit must put forth immutable laws whereby indibsputable ownership is established. This fundamental and foundational element of society shall forever and always be established under the mantle dibs.
        <br /><br />
        We, the first Congress of Dibs, hereby establish the laws of dibs which all civilized people are obligated to abide and follow under excruciating penalty which can include, but is not limited to, exile, dismemberment, mean-name calling, and execution until dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Articles of Dibs are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Should someone so desire to own an object, land, or collection, they must first proclaim “DIBS!!!” in the sight of God and man for all to hear. The three exclamation points are mandatory or the dibs claim is null and void. At least one living, human witness must be present when this occurs. This person must be able to hear or be a notary public if it needs to be in writing.</li>
